<p>Many people are familiar with PINs, which are used to access an
automated teller machine (ATM). From the system point of view, PINs
are used primarily in financial networks to authenticate users. Typically,
a user is assigned a PIN and enters the PIN at automated teller machines
(ATMs) to gain access to his or her accounts. It is extremely important
that the PIN be kept private so no one other than the account owner
can use it. </p>
