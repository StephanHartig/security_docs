<section><p>Consider that <keyword conref="wskc_conref-l0wskc04.dita#conref-l0wskc04/vbnmcvt"/> represents the capability to translate,
by definition, the limitations on the operations that a key can be
used for, into a different set of limitations. The control vector
is the heart of security against the misuse of keys that were defined
for a specific purpose. The masks that control what the key can be
translated into being able to do (the right and left masks) are themselves
single-length (8-byte), and are encrypted with DES. Therefore, the
protection against translating the key to have more power (or less
power) than it did before are protected with single-DES. This reduces
the security (somewhat) of a double-length DES key. You cannot decrypt
the double-length key with this approach, or gain access to a key
that you did not otherwise have the rights to use.  But you can make
a key which you already have access to, on a system you already have
access to, more powerful than it was before if you can break single-DES.</p></section>
