<section>
<p>TR-34 specifies an interoperable method for one situation â€“ the Distribution of Symmetric Keys
using Asymmetric Techniques from a Single Key Distribution Host (KDH) to many Key Receiving Devices
(KRDs). The KDH is assumed to be operated in a controlled environment. The KRDs may operate in
uncontrolled environments.</p>
<p> TR-34 is a Technical Report. This is different from a standard, which is a mandatory set of
rules that must be followed. A Technical Report is not mandatory, but provides guidance to those who
are using the standards. In this case, TR-34 is a companion to the ANSI X9.24-2 standard, which
defines requirements for key management performed using asymmetric key techniques.</p>
